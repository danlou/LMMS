The premise behind this model is that forces of natural selection change according to the density of the population . When an island is first colonized , the density of individuals is low and the population size increases with reduced levels of competition and an <b> abundance </b> of available resources . Under such circumstances a population experiences density independent forces of natural selection , which is called " r " - selection . When the population becomes crowded , it reaches the island 's carrying capacity , and individuals compete more heavily for limited resources .	6.8	10.0	6.0	7.0	8.0	9.0	7.0	7.0	2.0	2.0	10.0
